We have built a simple calculator with C using switch cases or if-else statements. This calculator takes two operands and an arithmetic operator (+, -, *, /) from the user, however, you can expand the program to accept more than two operands and one operator by adding logic. Then, based on the operator entered by the user, it conducts the computation on the two operands. The input, however, must be in the format “number1 operator1 number2” (i.e. 2+4). This simply works by taking three user inputs grouped into one scanf() function. These are seperated into valueOne, valueTwo and the operator (choice of *,/,+,-,^). A switch statement is then used in order to run the right calculation for the given operator.
